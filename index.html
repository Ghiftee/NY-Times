                <p class="article-pstyles">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named
                    Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                    equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
                    that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the
                    universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                    infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
                    swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles"><q>SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,</q> Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and
                    drew a double box around it.</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they
                    had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation,
                    looked right. </p>

                        Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
                        space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being
                        wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                        second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
                        colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

            <article class="article-3">
                <p class="article-pstyles">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
                    including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
                    comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang
                    itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
                    billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal
                    patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
                    own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like
                    a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
                <h3><q>As Big as It Gets</q></h3>
                <p class="article-pstyles">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at
                    energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into
                    gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves,
                    which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who
                    was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a
                    telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
                    microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000
                    years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
                <p class="article-pstyles">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for
                    Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific
                    briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
                    Astrophysical Journal.</p>
